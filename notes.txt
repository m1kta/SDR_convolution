 Bodges from Convolution SDR
This is NOT mine I make no claim it is, I put it here so I can work on my own bodges.

This a tad amuzing....

// Dear programmer:
// When I wrote this code, only god and
// I knew how it worked.
// Now, only god knows it!
// 
// Therefore, if you are trying to optimize
// this routine and it fails (most surely),
// please increase this counter as a
// warning for the next person:
// 
// total hours wasted here = 254
//

Need to specifically work out the FM and Digital routines for the T41 project
